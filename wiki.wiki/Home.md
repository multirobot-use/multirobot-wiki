Welcome to the **Multi UAV wiki** - where we explain in detail how to prepare your multi-UAV formation to develop experiments in real life.

This documentation is written by the **GRVC** Lab at Seville (Spain), check out the [GRVC website][website-grvc].

## Start working with our system!

For this wiki, it is important to mention that we are working with [grvc-ual][website-ual] as an abstraction layer and we are relying on [grvc-utils][website-utils] to get additional packages.

[grvc-ual][website-ual] is prepared to be working with Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04.
:construction: Currently working to make [grvc-ual][website-ual] work on Ubuntu 20.04.

[grvc-utils][website-utils] should be working on any version of Ubuntu greater than the 16.04.

## Questions or need help?
